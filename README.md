# DijkstraShortestPath
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm in C++

This program includes Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path in a directed graph
The shortestPathLengths function takes a graph and a starting vertex as parameters. It returns a map with each vertex and the shorted path to it.
v1.1: The map now has the length of the shortest path and a vector of vertices representing the shortest path from the start vertex to all the vertices
