# DFS
C++ Depth First Search Algorithm

This program includes the DFS class, which can be used to traverse a graph. The driver tests the DFS clas using an AdjacencyListGraph.
The DFS class uses decorators to see if a vertex or edge has been visited. For that reason, the Vertex and Edge classes in the Graph.h file need to inherit from Decorator
