# KruskalMST
Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm in C++

This program includes the MST function, which returns a list of edges that make up a minimum spanning tree of a given graph
The MST function uses Kruskal's algorithm. The MST function uses the disjoint sets and priority queue data structures.
